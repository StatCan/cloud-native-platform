&lt;p>The cloud native team presented to the Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Review Board. The presentation was well recieved with quite a few statements being really supportive of the architecture and even making reference that this is exactly what would be done in the private space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, some of the members who were working on the Amazon cloud service provider were keen to provide help and will be making a pull request so it can be supported as well. The meeting ended with GC EARB endorsing the architecture and asking us to present at an upcoming meeting of OneGC where a more technical deep dive can occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Enterprise Architecture Review Board just endorsed an open-source architecture that allows more flexibility in creating, publishing and managing web content.

&lt;p>The team have all returned home after another great KubeCon NA, and we thoroughly enjoyed our time in sunny San Diego.
We got to attend lots of amazing sessions, held many insightful conversations at the various booths, and learned quite a
bit from the phenomenal community. We tried where possible to share some of our reflections and insights learned each
day which has been refined into a list of key takeaways.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Kubernetes needs a Ruby on Rails moment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vendors are moving up the stack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CNCF community is amazing, but the tech can be challenging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multi-cloud is big business&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diverging Workflows: GitOps vs UI-driven&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>Blog: Stratosphere 2019 in Ottawa</title><link>https://govcloud.ca/blog/2019/06/20/stratosphere-2019-in-ottawa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://govcloud.ca/blog/2019/06/20/stratosphere-2019-in-ottawa/</guid><description>
