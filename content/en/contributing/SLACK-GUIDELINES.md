Slack is the main communication platform for Knative outside of our mailing
lists. Itâ€™s important that conversation stays on topic in each channel, and that
everyone abides by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct/). Community
members should all expect to have a positive experience.

Chat is searchable and public. Do not make comments that you would not say on a
video recording or in another public space. Please be courteous to others.

`@here` and `@channel` should be used rarely. Members will receive notifications
from these commands and we are a global project - please be kind. Note: `@all`
is only to be used by admins.

You can join the [Slack](https://stats-cloud.slack.com) instance at
https://stats-cloud.slack.com.

## Code of Conduct

The [CNCF Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct/) applies throughout the
project, and includes all communication mediums.
