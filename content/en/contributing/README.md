## Introduction

The cloud native platform for government (GovCloud) is built on top of Kubernetes with primarily CNCF projects for
primary use by the broader Canadian government.

## Authors

The project was started by Statistics Canada but has ambitions to grow in its reach.

For a current list of the authors, see
[Authors](https://github.com/statcan/cloud-native-platform/blob/master/AUTHORS).

## Meetings and work groups

We have bi-weekly meetings to discuss roadblocks and new features being worked on.
