## Slack Channel

The quickest way to get help is to post a question in [GCCollab][gccollab] under the **#cloudnative** channel.

## Raise a support ticket

You can [raise a support ticket][github] as an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Open Hours

We run a monthly "open hour" the last Friday of every month.

These are sessions in which you can discuss anything relating to the cloud platform.
