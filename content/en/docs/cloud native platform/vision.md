## Introduction

Product Vision for Cloud Native Platform

* Describes the purpose of the Product
* Provides a common understanding of the direction to move towards
* Guides and informs decisions regarding the platform

Helps to answer the following questions:

* Who is the target audience, the benefits it provides, the key features and the business goals for the organization
* This guides us in the direction of where we want to be, not necessarily what is available today

### Anatomy of a product vision board

![Vision](/images/cloudnative/vision.png "Vision")

5 main sections:

* Target Group (the group most likely to benefit from using the product)
* Needs (provided benefits, why would someone want to use the product)
* Product (key features of the product)
* Business Goals (benefits to the organization)
* Vision (the goal we want to achieve)

Target Group

* Encompasses both IT and non-IT users
* Encompasses the range of solution types (large-scale apps to smaller pieces of a much larger app)

Needs

* Enable solution builders to have more autonomy over their solutions and enforce the self-serve model
* Challenges from previous projects included the lack of consistency in infrastructure
* Environment were slightly different
* Usually required someone to manually intervene to make adjustments
* Broad knowledge of the differences was not widely known
* Bundling the documentation with the solution ensures this vital information is not decoupled

Product

* Security features on the platform that solutions can benefit from
* CNCF: well supported community of open source projects
* Observability: enables a better understanding as to why something went wrong

Business Goals

* Rather than pay for infrastructure that may sit dormant, it can be targeted when needed
* Fail fast: solutions could be deployed on Day 0 which enables early realization of success or failure, allowing teams to pivot in the right direction
* Aligns with the GoC Digital Standards and break the silos within IT (dev and operations)

Vision

* Highlights the key ideas: reliable, self-service, rapid deployment
