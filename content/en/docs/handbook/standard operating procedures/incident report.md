In the event that an incident is reported most notably from either an email or a JIRA issue. The first thing we must do is access if the incident occurs on a business critical system and / or if this impacts the business clients. The next consideration is whether this falls under our support hours and related SLA's.

When an incident does happen on a business critical system then we also have to file an official incident report that is then reviewed by the assistant director and ultimately send to the director himself.
