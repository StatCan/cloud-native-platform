## What is this initiative?

Based on the incredible work done by the [United States Department of Defense][us_dod]. This platform is an experimental approach to how the canadian government, particularly Statistics Canada, can deploy and operate software applications in a secure, flexible and interoperable manner.

Program developed in the open by [Statistics Canada][statcan].

Technology:

* Designing a scalable microservices oriented architecture integrated with a service mesh for built-in security
* Providing a common on-boarding experience across apps and support for the adoption of agile and DevSecOps practices
* Selecting, validating and deploying the best in class development tools and services
* Developing a sidecar container security stack (SCSS) for centralized logging and enforcement of a zero trust model
* Leveraging a centralized artifact repository of pre-hardened and validated containers
* Creating tutorials, screencasts and documentation to support pathfinders across the government

Business:

* Working with the Digital Academy to bring a state of the art DevSecOps curriculum
* Facilitating a new contracting model to ease procurement on tools with focus on DevSecOps
* Modernizing service delivery through a continuous authority to operate (ATO)

## Problem Statement

### What is DevSecOps?

A cultural and engineering practice that leverages the use of automated tooling to focus on the rapid and frequent delivery of secure infrastructure and software across the software development lifecycle.

### Why should I care?

Cyber security and software delivery encompass many key aspects of the Government of Canada's mandate while maintaining public trust.

* Deployment of applications in both a rapid and secure manner
* Integrated cyber security best practices and policies done transparently to the application developer
* Unified workflow and improved visibility of all development activities
* Enhanced application portability across the major cloud vendors as well as support for both on-premise and protected environments
* Leverage industry wide best practices with a focus on community strength

### Value for GoC Programs

* Enables bug and security fixes in days rather then weeks/months
* Enables automated testing and security compliance
* Enables a continuous authority to operate (ATO) process for improved deployment times
* Provides a built-in cyber security stack providing enhanced visibility of all services
* Can be deployed on any environment including all of the major cloud vendors
