The cloud native team presented to the Government of Canada Enterprise Architecture Review Board. The presentation was well recieved with quite a few statements being really supportive of the architecture and even making reference that this is exactly what would be done in the private space.

In addition, some of the members who were working on the Amazon cloud service provider were keen to provide help and will be making a pull request so it can be supported as well. The meeting ended with GC EARB endorsing the architecture and asking us to present at an upcoming meeting of OneGC where a more technical deep dive can occur.
